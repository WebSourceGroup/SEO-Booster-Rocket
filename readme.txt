The SEO Booster Rocket is used to increase your Wordpress Websites SEO Footprint. It currently uses Google Places & Maps API to create over 50,000 additional unique indexable URL\'s. These URL's are created by picking a search term (ex: Convenience Stores) and allows a user/search engine the ability to navigate to results by State, County & City. This system only supports US Geographies at this time. By using this software you agree that you are using this software at your Own Risk and that this software provides no guarantees. This plugin supports two short codes: [seo_booster_rocket_process_requests] &amp; [seo_booster_rocket_map]

== Description ==
Do you need to provide additional URL's to search engines like Google or Bing? Does your website have less than 20 pages but you'd wish to have 50,000? Is your website's content themed to include searchable Google Map Business Listings for every US State, County, and City? If you've answered yes to any of these questions then this SEO Boster Rocket might putt your website into orbit.

This plugin uses the Google Places API & the Google Maps API and combines it with a database of every US State, County, and Town, which can be downloaded after installation, that increases the searchable web pages by over 50,000 pages! Once you fill in the Place API, Maps API, Search Results URI & set your preferred Keyword you'll be able to submit an additional sitemap to your preferred search engine resulting in a massive increase of indexable pages!
