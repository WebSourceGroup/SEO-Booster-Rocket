The SEO Booster Rocket is used to increase your Wordpress Websites SEO Footprint. It currently uses Google Places & Maps API to create over 50,000 additional unique indexable URL\'s. These URL's are created by picking a search term (ex: Convenience Stores) and allows a user/search engine the ability to navigate to results by State, County & City. This system only supports US Geographies at this time. By using this software you agree that you are using this software at your Own Risk and that this software provides no guarantees. This plugin supports two short codes: [seo_booster_rocket_process_requests] &amp; [seo_booster_rocket_map]

== Description ==
Do you need to provide additional URL's to search engines like Google or Bing? Does your website have less than 20 pages but you'd wish to have 50,000? Is your website's content themed to include searchable Google Map Business Listings for every US State, County, and City? If you've answered yes to any of these questions then this SEO Boster Rocket might put your website into orbit.

This plugin uses the Google Places API & the Google Maps API and combines it with a database of every US State, County, and Town, which can be downloaded after installation, that increases the searchable web pages by over 50,000 pages! Once you fill in the Place API, Maps API, Search Results URI & set your preferred Keyword you'll be able to submit an additional sitemap to your preferred search engine resulting in a massive increase of indexable pages!

== Screenshots ==

1. Its easy to provide traditional Geographic Searches for your websites specific topic. Simply use the [seo_booster_rocket_map] shortcode. This is great functionality to provide your visitors if your website tailors to a specific topic of interest.

2. For the full SEO Booster Rocket experience you can list every US state & territory by using their full name. Each of these links are clickable and lead into the individual states/territory’s counties. Simply place the [seo_booster_rocket_process_requests] shortcode on your registered URI page.

3. The [seo_booster_rocket_process_requests] shortcode also displays every state/territory using their respective short name. Each of these links are clickable and lead into the individual states/territory’s counties.

4. Once you click a State, or Territory, you’ll then be sent to another listing containing Every County within the geography you selected. In this example, we’ve selected New York.

5. Once you click a County you’ll then be sent to another listing containing Every City within the geography you selected. In this example, we’ve selected Albany County in New York State.

6. Once you click on a specific City/Town you’ll then be sent to a search results page that contains a filled out search form, a map with results for your selected topic.

7. Additionally, the search results page also contains a basic table that contains actionable information so that your visitors/customers can make an educated decision.

8. The Administration page has a location for a Google Place & Google Maps API Key, a hard coded URI for a page containing the page that uses the SEO Booster Rocket shortcode, search cache age & an option to Show Support for the SEO Booster Rocket.

9. Just after activating the SEO Booster Rocket you’ll have to create the required database tables.

10. Once the tables are installed you’ll then have to install the Geographic data. This data is downloaded over an encrypted channel from our servers. (don’t forget to provide a positive review!)

11. Once the Geographic database is installed you’ll then see that, at the time of this writing, contains 63,207 unique geographic records that your site will now be able to use! (Don’t forget to submit the SEO Booster Rocket Site Map to your preferred search engines!)
